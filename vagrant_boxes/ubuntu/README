If you have trouble with VM taking forever to start saying "waiting for network configuration", edit '/etc/init/failsafe.conf' and remove/decrease the sleep statements.

To avoid losing access to shared folders after an upgrade to Vagrant/VirtualBox that doesn't match the 'guest additions' do this:
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
